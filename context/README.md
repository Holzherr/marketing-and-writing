# Context for AI Agents

This folder contains essential background information that AI agents should reference when generating content based on your specs.

## Files

- `brand-voice.md` - Your brand's personality, tone, and messaging guidelines
- `style-guide.md` - Writing style, formatting, and grammar preferences
- `audience.md` - Target audience information and characteristics

## Usage

When asking an AI agent to create content:
1. Reference the relevant spec from `/specs/`
2. Point the agent to these context files
3. The agent will use this information to match your voice and style

## Keeping Context Updated

Regularly update these files as your brand evolves or you refine your approach. The more detailed these files are, the better AI agents can match your style.
