## Post 3: AI as Third Parent - Parenting with ChatGPT

**Platform**: LinkedIn
**Date Published**: 4 weeks ago
**Status**: Published
**Related Spec**: [link to spec if applicable]

### Content

```
AI is the third parent in our household. It's been so helpful. 

Our second child turns 6 months this week and AI has been by our side through this journey.

From pregnancy and preparing our 3-year old, to dealing with a newborn's night wakes.

My wife and I asked ChatGPT questions daily - sometimes every few hours.

Over time, it picked up context about our family. Now the answers are personalised and grounded in past conversations. It genuinely makes parenting easier.

We used ChatGPT when Tara (now 3.5) was younger, but nothing like with Ashoka. With memory, ChatGPT now even connects what worked with Tara to what we're facing with Ashoka. That continuity is helpful. It remembers what strategies we found helpful and like. 

When you're waking up at 5am for the third time that night, AI's memory and advice is SO appreciated.

Here are real examples from the past year:

 👶 Behaviour & Toddler Management
Reducing toddler tantrums at bedtime
Strategies to help with thumb-sucking
Managing a toddler without triggering regressions or jealousy
 
😴 Sleep
Just now.. ChatGPT remembered my question "My toddler refuses the cot and screams violently… what do I do?"
Taking Cara Babies vs other sleep-training approaches
Logging sleep periods / windows and calculating progression and sharing month-by-month expectations
 
🤱 Postpartum Health & Wellbeing
Best foods to support physical recovery
Optimising sleep around a newborn
Exercise for recovery
 
🤝 Negotiation Between Parents
How to split nights intelligently
Rota planning that protects breastmilk supply and gives each parent restorative sleep
 
🏡 Productivity as a Founder + Parent
Setting up routines so life doesn't collapse around a newborn
How to protect focus time without burning out
 
✈️ Travel With Kids
Choosing a Zika-free, toddler-friendly holiday while pregnant 
Itinerary planning
Finding genuinely child-friendly accommodation

–

And for fun: I've attached a pitch deck ChatGPT generated for my wife from one prompt "Create a pitch deck based on the parenting questions I've asked you.". It's wild what a one-liner plus a year of context can do.

## Post 4: Walking Treadmill Desk Setup

**Platform**: LinkedIn
**Date Published**: 1 month ago
**Status**: Published
**Related Spec**: [link to spec if applicable]

### Content

```
My work productivity just went up. Last week I "accidentally" burnt 3,897 calories walking 47.27km over 21:04 hours, all from my desk.

My wife bought a walking treadmill for herself. I unboxed it for her… then thought "May as well try it for 10 mins."

10 minutes became 4 hours a day. 

What I've noticed / what ChatGPT says the research shows: 

✔ Calories burned (3,897 last week)
✔ Better blood sugar + cholesterol
✔ Less back/neck pain
✔ Higher mood + focus
✔ More stable energy
✔ Long-term heart benefits
✔ Easy to sustain - no extra willpower

I definitely *feel* higher focus / productivity. I leave my desk less. I find the walking helps me focus.

Unexpectedly - my gym sessions haven't dropped in intensity. I'm walking more but training the same.

I feel a little self conscious on some calls but my team is now used to it (I think?). One person has joined me and started walking too. 

It's been 10 days and I'm still doing it daily. 

I'm using a cheap treadmill (£80 from Amazon) and a cheap £180 standing desk (which I had already). 

Anyone else doing this? 
Any other favourite home-office hacks? 

I'll report back in a month on whether this sticks or whether it was just a 10-day obsession.

## Post 5: Federer Rule & Thanksgiving - Entrepreneurship & Marriage

**Platform**: LinkedIn
**Date Published**: 1 month ago
**Status**: Published
**Related Spec**: [link to spec if applicable]

### Content

Being successful at anything is really hard.

Roger Federer put it perfectly in his Dartmouth speech: "I won almost 80% of singles matches... but I only won 54% of points in those matches. Even top ranked tennis players win barely more than half the points they play." 

Entrepreneurship feels exactly like that. You lose a lot of points on the way to winning the match.

At Whisk.com, we had so many failures. Multiple pivots. Missed targets. And in 2015, we had to lay off our entire team (20 people) after we ran out of money — one of the toughest moments of my life.

My girlfriend Priyanka Mandal (now wife) encouraged me to carry on - her belief in me and promise of support regardless of the outcome gave me the confidence to carry on. Without that I'd have given up. 

This #thanksgiving.. I'm feeling very grateful for her. My greatest competitive advantage.

As Warren Buffett said "The most important decision you'll ever make is who you marry."
